## Versions
- **Operating System**: Windows 10, macOS Monterey, Ubuntu 20.04
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Tools**:
  - matplotlib (for visualization)
  - networkx (for graph visualization)
  - json (for reading/writing JSON files)

## Implementation Overview

This project consists of three main algorithms implemented in Python:

1. **Algorithm 1**: Generates test strings that belong to a specific grammar and those that do not. The grammar is defined as S → aSb | ε, which generates strings of the form {a^n b^n | n >= 0}.

2. **Algorithm 2**: Implements a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) that recognizes strings generated by the grammar defined in Algorithm 1. The PDA processes the strings and determines whether they are accepted or rejected.

3. **Algorithm 3**: Constructs and visualizes the derivation tree for valid strings and the computation tree (sequence of configurations) for the PDA. The trees are visualized using matplotlib and networkx.

## Instructions for Running the Implementation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib networkx
   ```

### Steps to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [repository_directory]
   ```

2. **Run Algorithm 1**:
   - Execute the ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_MCB_VZG.py script to generate test strings and save them in a JSON file.
   ```bash
   python ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_MCB_VZG.py
   ```
   - This will generate a file named test_strings.json containing the test strings.

3. **Run Algorithm 2**:
   - Execute the ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_MCB_VZG.py script to process the test strings using the PDA.
   ```bash
   python ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_MCB_VZG.py
   ```
   - This script will read the test_strings.json file, process each string, and print whether each string is accepted or rejected by the PDA.

4. **Run Algorithm 3**:
   - Execute the ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_MCB_VZG.py script to visualize the derivation trees and computation trees for the accepted strings.
   ```bash
   python ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_MCB_VZG.py
   ```
   - This script will generate visualizations of the derivation trees and computation trees for each accepted string. The visualizations will be saved in the resultados_arboles directory.

## Output

- **Algorithm 1**: Generates test_strings.json containing the test strings.
- **Algorithm 2**: Prints the acceptance or rejection status of each string.
- **Algorithm 3**: Generates visualizations of the derivation trees and computation trees, saved as PNG images in the resultados_arboles directory.

## Example Output

After running all three algorithms, you should see:
- A list of test strings in test_strings.json.
- A list of accepted and rejected strings printed in the console.
- Visualizations of the derivation and computation trees in the resultados_arboles directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter errors related to missing packages, ensure you have installed all required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **File Not Found**: Ensure that test_strings.json is generated by Algorithm 1 before running Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3.
